Welcome (me) to my new new blog. I’m creating this for the standard reasons: a selfish wish to share my personal thoughts, and deep existential dread. It won’t properly address either. 

This blog will be a place I post my new ideas. I’d like to try to post an idea daily, but it’s not clear yet how reasonable that will be. It’s probably very unreasonable. 

All the ideas I can think to post so far are all stupid, and I’m sure what I end up posting here will be stupider still. So, I’m going to purposely keep things open. It could be a new proposed way of making pottery - or a new short story plot - or a vague and general prediction of the future (to be deleted if wrong, of course).

I’ll check in tomorrow with a new idea. This blog counts as the new one for the day ::))
