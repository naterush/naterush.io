All the greatest things are just stacks of other less great things. Sandwiches? Just a big stack of bread, meat, cheese, pickles. Skyscrapers? Just a big stack of regular buildings.

New theory for why human civilization evolved so “well:” because we had opposable thumbs, we were better able to stack objects. And because we could stack things, we could create dense, information rich environments that had a similar effect on human productivity that the agricultural revolution did. 

If nothing else, this argument gives a compelling reason that sandwiches are a superior food - which is the only real goal, anyways.
