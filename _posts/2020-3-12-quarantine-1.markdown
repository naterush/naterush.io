It seems like we're going to enter into harsh "social distancing" mode as a US-of-A pretty soon. Which is pretty scary, but mostly really sad. Missing the last two months of senior year is an absolute bummer :(

I'm going to be chronicling some of the quarantine on this blog. Mostly, if I don't make a consistent and constant and contientious effort to not lose my mind, and depending on how long this quarantine goes on for, I'm going to lose it. 

Also, the above kinda assumes that the quarantine is going to happen. I'm pretty convincined it's going to, but remain hopeful it's not. Something something old saying. 

Anyways, setting goals is therapudic in it's own right. Writing these out kinda made me sad (mostly because I always set goals and never meet them), but also feeling like I have to set goals to not go crazy is, like, ugh. So meta-goal: become ok with goal setting here. I'm working on myself, and that's ok.

Here are some specific goals:
1. I'd like to run everyday.
2. I'd like to meditate every day.
3. I'd like to set aside "working hours" where I work. Like a job.
4. I'd like to make an explicit effort to build supportive long-distance social structures around myself and people around me. 

With (4), how to do that best? Seems like the design process should enter.
