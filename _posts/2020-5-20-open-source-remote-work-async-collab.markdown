# Open Source ~Vibes~

Most of the little I know about writing software I learned in an open source context. It wasn't a terribly large open source community, but I was contributing to a codebase, in the open, and meeting other random people who decided - for their own reasons - they should be contributing too.

Defining what I mean by "open source context" is not so easy. There are obvious signifiers: the source code is visible, and you can contribute, and you can hopefully fork it and make changes. But there are other pieces of open source that are less obvious but still present: a community of maintainers (however large), and (un)written norms about how and where and in what ways to start and continue contributing.

# Remote First Work

Remote first is all the rage. Remote first means that people won't be disadvantaged in a company if they don't come into the office; the company will explicitly design procedures to make sure that all team members get an equal and fair "company expirence" - no matter if they are in person or not. As far as I can tell, this mostly just means more Zoom happy hours. 

Open source is a perfect example of remote first work. You can't miss anything at the office if there isn't one, after all. 

Of course, not all remote first work is open source work. There's the obvious first order difference: not all remote work is done in the open. But really, the more interesting differences have to do with how teams exist and interact. 

# The Nature of the Firm

The Coase theorem gives 

So: we can understand teams in open source and teams in companies as being different because company teams, even when they are doing remote work, have lower transaction costs from the perspective of "who can make edits."

But notably, they don't have an easier time actually making those edits.
- Async collab in open source is for making the edits.
- Distribution is for permissions.

So, we can lower the tx costs for teams with async collab in teams, and only for open source is the distributed approach really relevant (except as far as it leads to a better ux in certain cases).

Warning: below here we get into the real speculation

Open source, in all ways, fits the bill for remote first work. But not all remote first work, is open source, of course. There's the obvious different that most remote work isn't going to suddenly start appearing in the open - of course. But because it's 




Open source, in almost all ways, is remote first. Remote first 




I'm not a great open source community maintainer, and I've never really contributed to a large open source programming project. But I learned to program in an open source community - my first mentor is currently the head of the Ethereum Research codebase (which probably has 100's of contributors now) - and I still feel the open source spirit coursing through my veins. 

It's not worth my time (or yours) to try to give an explict definition
