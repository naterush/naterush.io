Warning: this blog post is about spreadsheets, but somehow ends up speculating on AI as it relates to big data. 

A Private Equity firm is in the buisness of assumption creation, collection, and usage. They take their assumptions, built from experts, satellite images, reasonable historical projections, and package them into models. These models value companies, and PE firms get rich.

Let's, unfortunatly, be inspired by the efficient market hypothesis and ask: what does a competative market for valuing companies look like?

Given the above description of PE (given by someone with clear deep industry understanding, cough) - there are two areas these PE firms can compete: they can build better assumptions, or they can combine their assumptions in better ways. 

The latter is automation. Humans understand relationships between data pretty well, but computers do this much better - at least in the long term. Blah blah my pocket computer will be better than the most advanced Excel mode, given training data and good inputs. But it's not clear when we will get there. 

In the interim, while computers are getting-better-but-are-still-worse-than-human-and-computer-hybrids, building better assumptions also seems like a reasonable approach. 

Or speed. 




The latter is automation. Humans can understand and process relationships well, but computers can probably do this much better - at least in the long term. Given a sufficient training set, and some data as input, the model my future-computer can make will probably be better than any Excel anaylsis occuring today.
