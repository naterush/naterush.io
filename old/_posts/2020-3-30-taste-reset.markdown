Here's a terrible idea: I'd like to reset my preferences. 

Less dramatically - more specifically- I'm going to create a new Spotify account. This account will be the only account that I listen to music on, for the month after it's creation. 

Furthermore, I'm going to get a cool domain name -- something like tasteres.et (if it existed - it doesn't), and make a website where anyone with the link (and maybe a token of some sort) can go and suggest songs that _inform their taste_. These suggested songs will be the only songs I can listen to on this account.

I'm sure I'll get trolled heavily, but what a cool opportunity for me to learn about content moderation on a tiny scale. 

I'll market it lightly. And listen heavily to everything suggested. And hopefully change my taste a bit, before I ultimately return to live Mac DeMarco and JPEGMAFIA.
