Yeah, ok, the Taste Reset is not gonna happen. There's just no way I could really solicit good input from my friends with music, on an open platform. If I asked them indivigually, sure, they'd support. But an open platform? I'm asking to get trolled. 

And yeah, I know I said that thing about content moderation, but let's be real. I'm not equipped for that. 

So, instead: I'm going to build a simple script that downloads the recent albumbs that have been rated >8.0 on Pitchfork, and automatically add them to a playlist. It's more reasonable, I think, if a bit less romantic. Either that, or I'll just try to branch out more. Eh.
