The Correct by Construction (CBC) design process is a very interesting. The general idea can be summarized as: 

1. give a partial specification of a protocol. 
2. prove properties of this partial specification.
3. fill in the rest of the specification in way that preserved the properties proved above.

The benefits of the CBC process are many, but, to me, the most interesting are the simplicity it leads to - and how it allows for rapid iteration of the protocol (as long as the partial specification is not changed). 

Note that CBC design is itself a protocol - a protocol for designing protocols. So, naturally, the question arises: is there a Correct by Construction way of designing Correct by Construction protocols? 

I think the answer is probably yes - and also informative. Here would be the agenda of such a program:

1. specify a family of abstract specifications. 
2. prove that a certain set of properties of these protocols are invariant under further specification.
3. fill in the rest of the specification by picking one abstract specification from the family and showing the properties come from the set mentioned in step 2. 

The benefits of step 3 above are obvious. The work in creating a Correct by Construction protocol - and showing that it is actually Correct by Construction - seems to be greatly mitigated. And with the aforementioned simplicity and flexibility, I dream of a world where are protocols are Correct by Construction: not just consensus algorithms, but operating systems, cryptographic protocols, communication protocols, and much more. 

Once here, the question again arises: is there a Correct by Construction way of designing a Correct by Construction way of designing a Correct by Construction protocol? 

I think the answer is yes, but at some point (probably, here), the properties and proofs get general enough that they become useless. But I also havenâ€™t explored it yet, so I might be wrong.
