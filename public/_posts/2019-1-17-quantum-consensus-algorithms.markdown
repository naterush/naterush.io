DISCLAIMER: I have no idea what I’m talking about. 

Although I know as little as one could know about it, quantum computing seems very interesting. 

One of the more interesting factoids (that I don’t get the math behind) is the [CHSH game](https://sergworks.wordpress.com/2016/10/26/chsh-game-in-detail/).

Pretty much: two distributed agents can “coordinate” better, in some loose sense, better in a world where they exploit quantum entanglement. Which is crazy!

My theory is this: the question of liveness (any maybe safety too, although this would be more surprising) in consensus algorithms can be helped by taking advantage of quantum effects. I don’t know how, or why, but I’d love to hear if it were true.
