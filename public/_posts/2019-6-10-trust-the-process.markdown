The New York Times recently created a series called [Diary of a Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpMNJbt3QDE). Each video takes some famous song and overviews its creation: initial ideas, the songwriting process, musical ideas that made it through to the end (and those that died), etc. As someone-who-has-never-written a song, the process is very interesting to watch; the nice visuals are nice, too.

The Life of Pablo is a good album. At least, I like it. But when it was first released, many people were surprised by the sloppy production, [apparently](https://www.teetweets.com/products/kanye-west-ima-fix-wolves). Over the next 6 months, Kayne remixed, fixed, added and deleted from the album. The Life of Pablo isn’t the same Life of Pablo that it originally was. Which was interesting to watch. 

Songs are generally about 3 - 5 minutes because that’s the maximum length of audio that could be [recorded on disks](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6003271/why-are-songs-3-minutes-long). These disks that are not used any more. The internet is much more flexible than that.
