Quarantine update! I'm excited to write this post for no reason, which just goes to show you how much quarantine can addle your brain. 

I'm coming up on a month in hardcore social distancing; it wasn't meant to be that long, but I got sick with a week long stomach bug right before social distancing really started happening. Honestly, though, I'm doing alright with the exception of going a bit stir-crazy. 

## Old Goals

Let's review the goals I set in my previous post:

1. I'd like to run everyday.

Yes! I have been running a lot. When my legs are particularly sore, I bike, but they are uphill rides that feel like a substitute. So, (1) is being met. Good job Nate!

2. I'd like to meditate every day.

Uh, no. I failed this one hard. I meditated for two days and then gave up, mostly because I set the unreleastic goal of meditating for 1 hour each day. I'm gonna try again. New goal: meditate 10 minutes a day, every day. Yay for smaller goals!

3. I'd like to set aside "working hours" where I work. Like a job.

God no. I woke up at 1PM today. My sleep schedule is so destroyed this is effectively impossible, but in my defense, all the most fun and exciting things happen at 2am these days. That being said, I'm making an effort, starting tonight. I will be _in my bed_ by 2:30. No later. 

To give my self some credit though: I've been reading in bed rather than getting on my phone. So it's not all bad news. But I can do much better!

4. I'd like to make an explicit effort to build supportive long-distance social structures around myself and people around me. 

So-so. I've done a pretty good job with this up until this weekend, but I need to refocus and double down on making sure I reach out to my friends too!

## New Goals

There are some new goals I'd like to pick up!

5. I'd like to stream programming, every day. You know, like on [Twitch](https://twitch.com/sagavcs). Subscribe, sometime :).

6. I'd like to be nicer to my family. Like, doing this around the house nice. And not being mean because I'm cooped up. I don't think I'm the worse offender here, but I'm also not helping :)
