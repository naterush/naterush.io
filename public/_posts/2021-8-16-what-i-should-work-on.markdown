I think that there's a worthy consideration of "what is worth it" in the long term from AI risk.

Like:
- I think that it's very possible, at the current pace, that in 5 years from now, there are *very good* analysis tools that allow users to do real work with just AI.
- I not sure how the long-term vision of Mito fits into this. Additionally, I miss math a lot, and I want to be doing more.
