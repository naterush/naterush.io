It's been about a month since I've begun my journey into mechanistic interpretability - I'm the baby mentioned in the title!

This post is an overview of how I spent my time, what I found valuable, what I wish I did differently, and what resources would help other aspiring mech interp researchers like myself. 

- **If you're an aspiring mech interp researcher:** you can use this as a bar for how to learn effectively (if you're like me) - both what to do, and what not to do!
- **If you're an existing mech interp researcher:** this might give you insight into the onboarding process to mech interp, and some ideas for improving that onboarding.
- **If you're me:** this is a chance to reflect, so next month's learning can be even better.

# What my month has looked like

I quit my startup two months ago to work on AI Safety. I spent month one up-skilling on basic AI fundamentals, like building random basic algorithms [from scratch](https://github.com/naterush/nml) and [reading papers](https://www.naterush.io/posts/2024-7-10-paper-attention-is-all-you-need.markdown).

Around August 15th, I came across the [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org) program, which connects aspiring AI safety scholars with mentors in the field. MATS seemed perfectly aligned (ha ha) with my interest in as-technical-as-possible AI Safety research, so I decided I was going to go do my best to apply before the deadline - August 30th. 

The bulk of the application was a 10-16 hour solo research project, where applicants were asked to explore something interesting with transformers, some novel circuit, or SAEs. This project sounded great, with the only problem being that I only had a very vague idea of what any of "transformer" meant - not to mention SAEs... 

As such, I needed to get some basics under my belt before I could even attempt a solo research project. Luckily, the application had reccomendations for these prereqs: take the [Arena](https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app) ML learning course. So this is what I started on!

## Week 1: Arena - working with PyTorch for the first time

I spent the first week with [Arena chapter 0](https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.0]_Prerequisites). There are lessons (aka notebook exercises) on:
1. Tensors, einops, and einsum: very educational. Tensors were introduced well, but einops and einsum were introduced in a somewhat unmotivated way - I hadn't naturally encountered any problems that they would make it easier to solve. I would have done indexing first, then matrix operations, then einops and einsum.
2. Ray tracing: I mostly skipped this. It's clearly there as PyTorch practice, but I was in a time-crunch, and it required a fair bit of random math (collisions). I figured I'd get a fair bit more PyTorch practice if I just kept chugging.
3. CNNs and ResNets: fantastically educational. I built up to my first PyTorch model. This notebook took me a long time to get through (closer to two days). I understood neural network diagrams for the first time, how modules compose with each other, and felt pride in knowing what "convolution" meant.
4. Optimization: I completed this, but would skim this if I did this again. Loss landscapes are cool, and having intuition on this seems important at some point. But... I don't think it's that useful for your first month.
5. Backprop: skimmed, but didn't implement. I've derived and implemented back-prop from scratch before, so this didn't seem high-priority. And implementing computation graphs - not super relevant for me. Might be higher priority for you, if you've never touched backprop before.
6. VAEs and GANs: skipped entirely. I was anxious to get to language models. Have yet to feel like I'm missing this knowledge - so maybe that's fine!

**Overall, I highly reccomend the first week of the Arena course.** If you're looking to upskill as quickly as possible, I'd reccomend:
1. _Complete_: Tensors, einops, and einsum
2. _Skip_: Ray tracing
3. _Complete_: CNNs and ResNets
4. _Skim_: Optimization
5. _Skim_: Backprop
6. _Skip_: VAEs and GANs

## Week 2: Fella's First Transformers and Circuit Analysis

By week two, I was into [Arena chapter 1](https://arena3-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app). These lessons are much more focused on transformers specifically:
1. Transformers from scratch
2. Intro to mech interp
3. Superposition and SAEs
4. Interpretability with SAEs
5. Indirect Object Identification
6. Function Vectors & Model Steering
7. Balanced Bracket Classifier

As I was in a full-blown time-crunch now, expecting to have to finish these lessons and do my own research before the end of the week, I had to skip around a bit:

Lesson 1 (Transformers from scratch): Excellent, highly reccomend. This was led to actually understand how transformers work. One warning here: your partner might find you particuarly annoying post taking this lesson, as you'll be ranting and raving about transformers for a few days.

Lesson 2 (Intro to mech interp): Excellent, highly recommend. Warning that this is much longer than a day in my experience, and many of the later ideas (specifically around induction circuits) will be rattling in your head for a while. At least for me, despite high-effort, they didn't click on day one (or even day two).

Lesson 5 (Indirect Object Identification): I then skipped to the Indirect Object Identification - as I was aware that SAEs were a big, somewhat seperate research thread than the circuit analysis I had begun to do in Lesson 2. I got maybe halfway through this lesson before switching back to SAEs

Lesson 3 (Superposition and SAEs): skimmed. Implemented pieces of it where it seemed relevant. Looked at solutions. Helped me understand SAEs pretty clearly!

And with that, I ran out of time. It was Wednesday, and it was clear I wasn't going to get to the solo research project - so I emailed and asked for a week extension. I thankfully got one - which meant that next week was going to be for the solo research project!

If you're sprinting through mech interp, I've got less strong recs here. I'll note that circuit analysis (lessons 2 and lessons 5) are a totally seperate thread than SAEs (lessons 3 and 4). If you're like me, and in a time crunch to do any project, just pick one! I wish I had skipped the circuit analysis and spent all my time with SAEs - my solo research project would likely have come out more interesting.

## Week 3: SAE Project 

After reading the suggested ideas for interesting projects, I decided I would spend the week working with sparse autoencoders. The project I embarked on turned [into this write-up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19t1UerxvN1spgPhYR8064Iom11CYCtm8ALs9cHePXqE/edit?usp=sharing). 

I aimed for about four hours of active work per day. At the start, this work was really choppy. I didnâ€™t use a good GPU until day two, because I had never trained a large model before - so that wasted a bunch of time. I also lost a fair bit of work to Google Colab clearing storage overnight - whoops.

Even with this choppiness, this week was a week of magnificent learning. Rather than being able to give up, I was forced to struggle through any issue I ran into: modifying the code of the libraries I was using to work around their limitations, writing my own analysis functions from scratch because of missing documentation, training and retraining because my learning rate was too high and caused exploding gradients, etc. 

Moreover, the process of documenting and communicating what I worked on was dramatically more valuable than I expected it to be. It forced me to clarify where I was confused vs. unsure, allowed me to think and plan for next steps on this project, and 

Overall, this week was the most frustrating, most enjoyable, and most educational week for me - at least when it comes to being a mech interp researcher. I plan to focus on weeks this going forward.

## Week 4: where I'm at now

This week, I've picked my head up. I'm writing this in case it's useful to anyone else, and to give myself the chance to reflect on what what worked for me. There's going to be many more months of learning, and I want to make them as effective and useful as possible. 

In poking my head up, I've been:
1. Reading more about the overall [tech tree](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/getting-started) for mech interp. What pieces of it am I most interested in? What seems understudied?
2. Talking to folks who do AI safety research currently. I've been in a little solo box for a few weeks, but that's no fun. 
3. Setting up infrastructure for myself so I can continue my research outside of Google Colab and instead work in VSCode, which I much prefer. 
4. Continuing my SAE research. The process of doing research, and then actually documenting it - this is the most important thing!
5. Committing to posting my SAE work publicly. Let's not be fearful now. Any feedback is good feedback this early, as I might be doing things totally wrong.
6. Doing this reflection, so that I can continue to learn more effectively.

I'd describe myself as a mechanistic interpretability amature now. Not a noob anymore, but an amature. Not sure it's true, but even if it's aspirational I'm fine with that.

# How are the libraries for beginners?

Quick interlude: let's review the four libraries I used most over the past four weeks. I've opened a few PRs and issues against some of these - so hopefully this does not come across as just throwing stones. I! Promise! I'm! Not! That! Sort! Of! Open! Source! User! 

## PyTorch

For a beginner, PyTorch is quite excellent:
1. The public APIs are consistent and well-scoped, making them easy to remember and use.
2. The documentation is _fantastic_. I really had a joy reading it, and caught myself reading docs for fun at points. Silly boy, it's research time!
3. Component / model modularity is excellent. Auto-diff is a joy, especially because I'm used to writing everything from scratch (this got old).

The only two consistent complaints I have with PyTorch: 
1. Wrong device errors are annoying (but very easily fixable).
2. Indexing. Despite being a very experienced Python programmer with a fair bit of numpy experience, fancy indexing can be really hard to remember. -1 point for this, although I don't have any interface suggestions.

Overall, PyTorch is an excellent, robust, and very well documented. 9/10 for a beginner, with only one decrement for how hard it can be to index in how you want sometimes.

## CircuitVis

As I primarily focused on SAEs, I didn't use the full capabilities of this library. However, it was still useful for visualizing the 
1. Small, clean API for what I wanted to do.
2. Documentation that led me to this API very easily (in the README!).

My only criticism is that I found a [small bug](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/CircuitsVis/issues/92), but it didn't really effect my work. 

For a beginner, 9/10!

## TransformerLens

I used TransformerLens non-stop throughout my SAE project, and through many of the Arena notebooks as well. 
1. Very capable API. I mostly was recording results rather than intervening on activations, but there was nothing I wanted to do that I couldn't!
2. Consistent (if a bit verbose) public API. I knew generally what function I wanted, even if I forgot the name of the specific output to hook against.
3. Comprehensive documentation for a small library.

In general, I only had two issues with TransformerLens:
1. The API for getting data "out" of hooks is a bit cumbersome: you need to either define global variables, or use partial function application. I think an interface that looks closer to a functional "reduce" would be a better API for data collection. 
2. Some memory leak issues. I'm not an experienced GPU programmer, but sometimes running a HookedModel would result in GPU memory never being returned (despite me apparently deleting all relevant GPU-stored variables).

Overall, TransformerLens is capable and functional, and the issues are small warts on a well-working library. 8/10 for beginners.

## SAELens

SAELens was the bulk of my project, and I would say I spent much of my time fighting with it. This section below is meant as constructive feedback - because ultimately, I was able to train three SAEs using this library that accomplished what I intended.

The issues I had with it:
1. Lack of documentation across the board. There is not much documentation at all, and the tutorials that do exist were mostly out of date. 
2. Lack of analysis functions. Honestly, these do exist - but how to use them is a mystery. So I ended up recreating a lot of these by myself (or by reverse-engineering someone elses code).
3. Forced Neuronpedia integration. I'm sure Neuronpedia is good - but it wasn't what I needed (or thought I needed). So it mostly felt in the way.
4. Unclear class hierarchy. If you fully train an SAE, the class you get back is called a TrainingSAE for example.

For beginners, these limitations make this library a bit hard to work with - bringing it in at a 4/10. 

SAELens is the start of a great SAE library. Please don't take this as a random roast - I'm looking forward to contributing myself to help build something great for the open-source mech-interp stack!

# Overall Reflections and iterations

### What I've done well:
1. Tied this learning to a specific deadline with a concrete output. The MATS application was a kick in the butt - in a good way. Hopefully I can particate in the program for a continued dose of that!
2. Aiming for steady, consistent learning. I've been pacing myself well, with a few hours of hard deep work per day. In practice, I find this much more sustainable and enjoyable than 12 hours of new material every day.
3. Working on a solo project, rather than just doing predefined lessons. For me, this is the most useful and fun way to learn. I should continue to double down on this - and only return to lessons if/when I need something specific.
4. Contributing back to open source projects. This is good for the community, good for my learning, and good for the soul!

### What I could have done better:
1. Talked to folks in the space from the very start. I think I had a fear of talking to folks without knowing anything - but this is more harmful than it is useful!
2. Focused on SAEs earlier. This is specific to the application I was working on, but I wish I went deeper rather than wider - I think I would have ultimately learned much more. 
3. Figured out a scalable tech stack earlier. For example, [this post](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/getting-started) would have made clear I need to think about this - and saved me a bunch of pain and time.

### What resources I wish existed:

Overall, I would rate my onboarding experience as an 8/10. There's clearly been a lot of thought, care, effort, and money put into resources for aspiring mech interp researchers - which is really great. The first few weeks of this journey were effectively just learning with no cruft. 

However, the transition from super-small toy models and small GPUs to more-real projects could use a bit of work. I think the most useful changes would be:

1. Recommended VSCode tech stack. Where should I get a virtual machine with a good GPU? How can I easily hook this up to VSCode? Colab was excellent for the first two weeks, and a huge productivity hit for the later week. Let's make that transition smoother.
2. Aspiring-researcher GPU fund. As I quit my job to do AI Safety, I don't have funds to rent/buy a good GPU. I wish I could fill out a <5 minute application, and get access to an A100 GPU for 10 hours, and then show my results, and then get another 10 hours, etc etc. Yes, I've applied to the transition funds like the Open Phil Transition Fund - but these applications are long, and the turnaround time is in weeks! Not so useful for just getting started. 
3. Documentation for analysis using SAELens. This exists in Arena (although I didn't find it until I went looking right now) - but it is missing (or very hard to find) from the SAELens library. I had to roll most SAE analysis from scratch. Maybe great for learning, but probably not how we want things to work!
