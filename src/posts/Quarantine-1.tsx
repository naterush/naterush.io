<div>It seems like we&apos;re going to enter into harsh &apos;social distancing&apos; mode as a US-of-A pretty soon. Which is pretty scary, but mostly really sad. Missing the last two months of senior year is an absolute bummer :(</div>

<div>I&apos;m going to be chronicling some of the quarantine on this blog. Mostly, if I don&apos;t make a consistent and constant and contientious effort to not lose my mind, and depending on how long this quarantine goes on for, I&apos;m going to lose it. </div>

<div>Also, the above kinda assumes that the quarantine is going to happen. I&apos;m pretty convincined it&apos;s going to, but remain hopeful it&apos;s not. Something something old saying. </div>

<div>Anyways, setting goals is therapudic in it&apos;s own right. Writing these out kinda made me sad (mostly because I always set goals and never meet them), but also feeling like I have to set goals to not go crazy is, like, ugh. So meta-goal: become ok with goal setting here. I&apos;m working on myself, and that&apos;s ok.</div>

<div>Here are some specific goals:</div>
<div>1. I&apos;d like to run everyday.</div>
<div>2. I&apos;d like to meditate every day.</div>
<div>3. I&apos;d like to set aside &apos;working hours&apos; where I work. Like a job.</div>
<div>4. I&apos;d like to make an explicit effort to build supportive long-distance social structures around myself and people around me. </div>

<div>With (4), how to do that best? Seems like the design process should enter.  </div>
